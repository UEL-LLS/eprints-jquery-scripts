eprints-jquery-scripts
======================

Attempt to consolidate all the scripts used in UELs ROAR theme and theme package. 

Scripts all do little things to add classes or take them away. Allows Bootstarp to work without having to alter EPrints core.


To use them, simply download and place the needed script somewhere eprints can access. Then call them up at the end of your tepmplate file.
